## Project Overview
You are working with an educational Go project designed to teach programming fundamentals. This project prioritizes **learning clarity** over performance or advanced patterns.

## Key Principles
1. **Educational First**: Every code example should teach a concept clearly
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, build up gradually
3. **Comprehensive Comments**: Explain the "why" not just the "what"
4. **Runnable Examples**: All code should be immediately executable
5. **Self-Contained**: Each example should work independently

## Project Structure
- **basics/** - Variables, operators, conditionals (fully tested)
- **functions/** - All function concepts (fully tested)
- **loops/** - Iteration patterns (needs tests)
- **cmd/** - Demo runners for each module
- **.ai/** - AI-friendly documentation

## When Making Changes

### DO:
- Maintain the educational tone in all comments
- Add examples that build on existing concepts
- Create tests for new functionality
- Update demo runners when adding features
- Keep error messages educational
- Use descriptive variable names

### DON'T:
- Remove explanatory comments for brevity
- Use advanced patterns before teaching basics
- Optimize for performance over clarity
- Add external dependencies
- Break existing examples

## Common Tasks
- **Add new concept**: Add to appropriate module file, update demo runner
- **Fix issue**: Maintain educational value while fixing
- **Add module**: Create directory, main file, test file, demo runner
- **Improve examples**: Add more cases, better explanations

## Quick Commands
```bash
go run main.go                    # Project overview
go run cmd/01-basics/main.go     # Basics demo
go run cmd/02-functions/main.go  # Functions demo
go run cmd/03-loops/main.go      # Loops demo
go test ./...                     # Run all tests
```

## Current State
- Basics and Functions modules are complete with tests
- Loops module is complete but needs tests
- Ready for new modules: structs, slices, maps, interfaces

## Remember
This is a learning project. Every line of code should teach something. When in doubt, choose the approach that is easiest to understand, even if it's not the most efficient or idiomatic.
