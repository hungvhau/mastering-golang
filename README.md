## Learning Modules

### 1. Basics Module
Located in the `basics/` directory, this module covers fundamental Go concepts:

- **Variables and Constants**: Declaration and usage of `var` and `const`
- **Data Types**: Working with `int`, `string`, `bool`, and `float64`
- **Basic Operators**: Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %)
- **Conditionals**: Control flow with `if`, `else`, and `switch`

### 2. Functions Module
Located in the `functions/` directory, this module covers all aspects of functions in Go:

- **Basic Functions**: Simple function declarations with the `func` keyword
- **Parameters and Returns**: Passing arguments and returning single/multiple values
- **Named Returns**: Functions with pre-declared return variables
- **Error Handling**: The Go idiom of returning errors
- **Variable Scope**: Local vs global variables, shadowing, and block scope
- **Anonymous Functions**: Function literals and immediately invoked functions
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions as first-class citizens
- **Closures**: Functions that capture external variables
- **Variadic Functions**: Functions with variable number of arguments
- **Deferred Execution**: Using `defer` for cleanup operations
- **Recursion**: Functions that call themselves
- **Methods**: Functions with receivers attached to types

### 3. Loops Module
Located in the `loops/` directory, this module covers Go's versatile for loop and control flow:

- **Basic For Loop**: Traditional C-style loops with initialization, condition, and post statement
- **While-Style Loops**: Using for loops without init and post statements
- **Infinite Loops**: Creating and breaking out of endless loops
- **Break and Continue**: Controlling loop execution flow
- **Range Keyword**: Iterating over arrays, slices, maps, strings, and channels
- **Nested Loops**: Working with multi-dimensional data structures
- **Labeled Break/Continue**: Controlling outer loops from inner loops
- **Loop Patterns**: Common patterns like filtering, transformation, and accumulation
- **Performance Considerations**: Writing efficient loops with pre-allocation and caching

## Running the Examples

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run the overview/guide
go run main.go

# Run basic concepts demo
go run cmd/01-basics/main.go

# Run functions demo
go run cmd/02-functions/main.go

# Run loops and control flow demo
go run cmd/03-loops/main.go
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests in the project
go test ./...

# Run tests with verbose output
go test -v ./...

# Run tests for a specific package
go test -v ./basics
```

## Learning Path

1. **Start with the overview**: Run `go run main.go` to understand the project structure
2. **Learn the basics**: Run `go run cmd/01-basics/main.go` to see fundamental concepts in action
3. **Explore functions**: Run `go run cmd/02-functions/main.go` to understand Go's function features
4. **Master loops**: Run `go run cmd/03-loops/main.go` to learn Go's powerful for loop and control flow
5. **Study the code**: Read through the well-commented source files:
   - Start with `basics/variables.go` for variable declarations
   - Move to `basics/operators.go` for arithmetic operations
   - Study `basics/conditionals.go` for control flow
   - Deep dive into `functions/functions.go` for comprehensive function concepts
   - Master `loops/loops.go` for all loop patterns and control flow techniques
6. **Run the tests**: Use `go test -v ./basics` to see how the functions are tested
7. **Experiment**: Modify the code and create your own examples

## Go Best Practices Demonstrated

### Package Organization
- Clear separation of concerns with `basics` and `functions` packages
- Each package has its own executable `main.go` for demonstrations
- Test files are co-located with the code they test

### Code Quality
- Comprehensive inline documentation explaining concepts
- Meaningful variable and function names
- Consistent formatting following `gofmt` standards
- Proper error handling patterns

### Project Structure
- Module-based organization for easy navigation
- Separate executable programs for different learning topics
- Central entry point (`main.go`) providing guidance
- Clean import paths using the module name

### Testing
- Test-driven development approach
- Comprehensive test coverage for basic concepts
- Clear test function names describing what is being tested

## Requirements

- Go 1.21 or higher
- Basic understanding of command-line operations
- Text editor or IDE with Go support (recommended: VS Code with Go extension)

## AI-Friendly Documentation

This project includes special documentation to help AI assistants understand and expand the codebase efficiently:

### ü§ñ AI Configuration Files
- **`.ai/context.json`** - Machine-readable project structure and conventions
- **`.ai/codemap.md`** - Quick navigation guide to all modules
- **`.ai/learning-roadmap.md`** - Concept dependencies and progression
- **`.ai/common-tasks.md`** - Patterns for common modifications
- **`.ai-prompt.md`** - Universal context for any AI tool

### üìù Prompt Templates
- **`.ai/prompt-template.md`** - Detailed guide for writing effective prompts
- **`.ai/QUICK_PROMPT_GUIDE.md`** - Quick reference with copy-paste templates
- **`.ai/BOOTSTRAP.md`** - How to ensure AI reads the context files

### üöÄ Starting a New AI Session

**Important**: AI assistants don't automatically know about these files! Start with:

```
I'm working on the mastering-golang educational project. 
Please read .ai/context.json for project structure and .ai-prompt.md for guidelines.
```

Or use the shorter prefix for any prompt:
```
[mastering-golang edu project, see .ai/ docs] Add pointers to basics module...
```

### Example Prompt for Adding Content:
```
[mastering-golang edu project, see .ai/ docs]
Add pointers to basics module after learners understand functions.
Show pointer declaration, dereferencing, and passing pointers to functions.
Include the classic "swap values" example and explain memory efficiency.
Focus on when to use pointers vs values.
```

These files help AI assistants:
- Understand the project structure instantly
- Maintain educational consistency
- Follow established patterns
- Add content in the correct progression

## Next Steps

After mastering these basics, consider exploring:
- Arrays and Slices
- Maps and Structs
